what is the first book printed?
," The Gutenberg Bible, also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42, was the earliest major book printed in Europe using mass-produced metal movable type."
,"It marked the start of the 'Gutenberg Revolution' and the age of printed books in the West."
,The book is valued and revered for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities and its historical significance.  
,"The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Latin Vulgate printed in the 1450s by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz, in present-day Germany."
,Forty-nine copies (or substantial portions of copies) have survived.
,"They are thought to be among the world's most valuable books, although no complete copy has been sold since 1978."
,"In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible displayed in Frankfurt to promote the edition, and that either 158 or 180 copies had been printed. "
,"The 36-line Bible, said to be the second printed Bible, is also sometimes referred to as a Gutenberg Bible, but may be the work of another printer. "
,"The Gutenberg Bible, an edition of the Vulgate, contains the Latin version of the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament."
,"It is mainly the work of St Jerome who began his work on the translation in AD 380, with emendations from the Parisian Bible tradition, and further divergences. "
,"While it is unlikely that any of Gutenberg's early publications would bear his name, the initial expense of press equipment and materials and of the work to be done before the Bible was ready for sale suggests that he may have started with more lucrative texts, including several religious documents, a German poem, and some editions of Aelius Donatus's Ars Minor, a popular Latin grammar school book. "
,"Preparation of the Bible probably began soon after 1450, and the first finished copies were available in 1454 or 1455."
,It is not known exactly how long the Bible took to print.
,The first precisely datable printing is Gutenberg's 31-line Indulgence which certainly existed by 22 October 1454. 
,Gutenberg made three significant changes during the printing process. 
,"Some time later, after more sheets had been printed, the number of lines per page was increased from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper."
,"Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each."
,"Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear."
,"The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the interline spacing, rather than increasing the printed area of the page."
,"Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed."
