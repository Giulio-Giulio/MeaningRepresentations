When was the first computer virus discovered?
0," A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into those programs."
0,"If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be 'infected' with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses. "
0,Computer viruses generally require a host program.
0,The virus writes its own code into the host program.
0,"When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage."
0,"By contrast, a computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk."
0,"Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks. "
0,Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus.
0,Viruses use complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software.
0,"Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit (e.g., with ransomware), desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues, artificial life and evolutionary algorithms. "
0,"As of 2013, computer viruses caused billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year."
0,"In response, an industry of antivirus software has cropped up, selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems. "
2,"The first academic work on the theory of self-replicating computer programs was done in 1949 by John von Neumann who gave lectures at the University of Illinois about the 'Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata'."
0,"The work of von Neumann was later published as the 'Theory of self-reproducing automata'."
0,In his essay von Neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself.
1,"Von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical 'father' of computer virology."
1,"In 1972, Veith Risak directly building on von Neumann's work on self-replication, published his article 'Selbstreproduzierende Automaten mit minimaler Informationsübertragung' (Self-reproducing automata with minimal information exchange)."
0,The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 4004/35 computer system.
0,"In 1980, Jürgen Kraus wrote his Diplom thesis 'Selbstreproduktion bei Programmen' (Self-reproduction of programs) at the University of Dortmund."
0,In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses.
