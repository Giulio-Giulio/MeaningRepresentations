, "Software is a collection of programs and data that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks."
, "Software often includes associated software documentation."
, "This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work."
, "At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU)."
,"Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state."
,"For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user."
,"An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example, displaying some text on a computer screen, causing state changes that should be visible to the user."
,"The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to 'jump' to a different instruction or is interrupted by the operating system."
,"As of 2024, most personal computers, smartphone devices, and servers have processors with multiple execution units, or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past."
, The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages."
, "They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages."
, "High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler, an interpreter, or a combination of the two."
, "Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language that has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler. "
,"An algorithm for what would have been the first piece of software was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, for the planned Analytical Engine."
, "She created proofs to show how the engine would calculate Bernoulli numbers."
, "Because of the proofs and the algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer."
, "The first theory about software, prior to the creation of computers as we know them today, was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1936 essay, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem)."
, 'This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of computer science and software engineering; both fields study software and its creation.'
, "Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering principles to development of software. "
, "In 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that John Wilder Tukey\'s 1958 paper 'The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics' contained the earliest known usage of the term 'software' found in a search of JSTOR\'s electronic archives, predating the Oxford English Dictionary\'s citation by two years."
