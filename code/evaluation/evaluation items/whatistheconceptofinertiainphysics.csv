What is the concept of inertia in physics?
2," Inertia is the tendency of objects in motion to stay in motion, and objects at rest to stay at rest, unless a force causes its speed or direction to change."
2,"It is one of the fundamental principles in classical physics, and described by Isaac Newton in his first law of motion (also known as The Principle of Inertia)."
2,"It is one of the primary manifestations of mass, one of the core quantitative properties of physical systems."
0,Newton writes: LAW I.
1,"Every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, except insofar as it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. "
2,"In his 1687 work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Newton defined inertia as a property: DEFINITION III."
2,"The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a right line. "
0,Professor John H. Lienhard points out the Mozi – based on a Chinese text from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) – as having given the first description of inertia.
0,"Before the European Renaissance, the prevailing theory of motion in western philosophy was that of Aristotle (384–322 BCE)."
1,"On the surface of the Earth, the inertia property of physical objects is often masked by gravity and the effects of friction and air resistance, both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects (commonly to the point of rest)."
0,This misled the philosopher Aristotle to believe that objects would move only as long as force was applied to them.
0,Aristotle said that all moving objects (on Earth) eventually come to rest unless an external power (force) continued to move them.
0,"Aristotle explained the continued motion of projectiles, after being separated from their projector, as an (itself unexplained) action of the surrounding medium continuing to move the projectile. "
0,"Despite its general acceptance, Aristotle's concept of motion was disputed on several occasions by notable philosophers over nearly two millennia."
0,"For example, Lucretius (following, presumably, Epicurus) stated that the 'default state' of the matter was motion, not stasis (stagnation)."
0,"In the 6th century, John Philoponus criticized the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where the medium would hinder a body's motion."
0,"Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of a surrounding medium, but by some property imparted to the object when it was set in motion."
0,"Although this was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for a power to keep a body in motion, it proved a fundamental step in that direction."
0,This view was strongly opposed by Averroes and by many scholastic philosophers who supported Aristotle.
0,"However, this view did not go unchallenged in the Islamic world, where Philoponus had several supporters who further developed his ideas. "
