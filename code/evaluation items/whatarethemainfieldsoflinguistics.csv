what are the main fields of linguistics?
0, Linguistics is the scientific study of language.
0,"Linguistics is based on a theoretical as well as a descriptive study of language and is also interlinked with the applied fields of language studies and language learning, which entails the study of specific languages."
0,"Before the 20th century, linguistics evolved in conjunction with literary study and did not employ scientific methods.  "
0,"Modern-day linguistics is considered a science because it entails a comprehensive, systematic, objective, and precise analysis of all aspects of language â€“ i.e., the cognitive, the social, the cultural, the psychological, the environmental, the biological, the literary, the grammatical, the paleographical, and the structural. "
2,"Traditional areas of linguistic analysis correspond to syntax (rules governing the structure of sentences), semantics (meaning), morphology (structure of words), phonetics (speech sounds and equivalent gestures in sign languages), phonology (the abstract sound system of a particular language), and pragmatics (how social context contributes to meaning)."
1,Subdisciplines such as biolinguistics (the study of the biological variables and evolution of language) and psycholinguistics (the study of psychological factors in human language) bridge many of these divisions. 
1,Linguistics encompasses many branches and subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications.
0,Theoretical linguistics (including traditional descriptive linguistics) is concerned with understanding the universal and fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical framework for describing it.
0,"Applied linguistics seeks to utilise the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes, such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy. "
0,"Linguistic features may be studied through a variety of perspectives: synchronically (by describing the shifts in a language at a certain specific point of time) or diachronically (through the historical development of language over several periods of time), in monolinguals or in multilinguals, amongst children or amongst adults, in terms of how it is being learned or how it was acquired, as abstract objects or as cognitive structures, through written texts or through oral elicitation, and finally through mechanical data collection or through practical fieldwork. "
0,"Linguistics emerged from the field of philology,  of which some branches are more qualitative and holistic in approach."
0,"Today, philology and linguistics are now variably described as related fields, subdisciplines, or separate fields of language study but, by and large, linguistics can be seen as an umbrella term."
1,"Linguistics is also related to the philosophy of language, stylistics, rhetoric, semiotics, lexicography, and translation. "
0,"Historical linguistics is the study of how language changes in history, particularly with regard to a specific language or a group of languages."
0,"Western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late 18th century, when the discipline grew out of philology, the study of ancient texts and oral traditions. "
0,"Historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practised during the late 19th century."
0,"Despite a shift in focus in the 20th century towards formalism and generative grammar, which studies the universal properties of language, historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry."
1,Subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalisation. 
0,Historical linguistics studies language change either diachronically (through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present) or in a synchronic manner (by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language). 
0,"At first, historical linguistics was the cornerstone of comparative linguistics, which involves a study of the relationship between different languages."
